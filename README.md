Simple project to
1. Create c++ using CMake.
2. Use gtest for testing.
3. Use parameterized testing.
4. Use VSCode.
5. Use latest gtest. (replace googletest folder with latest google test to update)

Why not use Test adapter for Google test in Visual Studio?
1. Test Adapter for Google Test is outdated.
2. Alternative Google Test Adapter is also outdated.
3. Uses old Google test (some function does not exist).
4. Google Test official documentation cannot be used since newer Google Test function are missing.
